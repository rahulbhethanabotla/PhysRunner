### This is a project I worked on in the summer of 2016. It was my first project ever. It was super fun making it, even if it certainly is rough around the edges. I hope you like it.
### AS OF THE CURRENT DATE checking this project, DECEMBER 23 2016, I found out that Swift 3 has been released, so this project is filled with deprecated code.
